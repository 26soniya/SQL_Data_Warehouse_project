## Project Requirements

## Building the Pipeline 

### Objectives
Develop a robust machine learning solution to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset by leveraging historical passenger data and applying structured preprocessing and modeling techniques.

### Specifications
- **Data Source**: Titanic dataset  from Kaggle
- **Data Quality**: Handle missing values, inconsistent categorical data, and feature imbalance
- **Feature Engineering**: Encode categorical variables, scale numerical features, and drop non-informative columns
- **Data Splitting**: Apply stratified sampling to preserve target and key feature distributions
- **Pipeline Design**: Use scikit-learn Pipelines for clean, reusable, and leakage-free preprocessing
- **Modeling**: Train and tune machine learning models using cross-validation
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance on unseen test data
